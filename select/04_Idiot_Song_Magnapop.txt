Nothing's here
Nothing is
There's nothing here
To patronize
I can't relax
And close the book in my mind
On the subject

I've seen places change
I've seen faces changing too
Change your hair
Change your name
Change your mind
Change your name
There's nothing here to hate
Nothing worse than being late
Be committed
Be polite
Be on top of who you are

I've seen places change
I've seen faces changing too
Change your hair
Change your name
Change your mind
Change your name
There's nothing here to hate
Nothing worse than being late
Be committed
Be polite
Be on top of who you like
