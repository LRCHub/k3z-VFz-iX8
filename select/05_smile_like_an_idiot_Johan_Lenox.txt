Gary tried to kick me out my house for being too loud
He called the cops on me it wasn't even me
All I want to do is bump into him act like nothing happened
Yeah I know he's gonna freak the fuck out

And then my best friend of ten years called me up
Yea I can tell he's on his tenth beer
Telling me a story, how he's always getting horny when he's drunk
An opportunity arises in the form of my girlfriend
I guess that's my ex-GF

All I do is smile like an idiot
Acting like I'm fine, I don't give a shit
I'll be staying high till I'm sick of it
All I do is smile, all I do is smile
If losing is a game, I'd be winning it
Acting like I'm fine, I don't give a shit
All I do is smile, all I do is smile

Here I am between calls with the people
Formerly known as my girl and my best friend
Then my mom calls me up says it's time to cut me off
And rent is due tomorrow, this ain't happening
