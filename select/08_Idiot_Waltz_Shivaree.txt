What have I done with the baby tonight
Every one wants to play
The phone just stopped ringing
I forgot how to sing and
There's no more room at the table
Heard you all talking and toasting last night
But somebody's just barely there
The kitchens too hot and she's roasting alright
And I miss my usual chair
Here comes that shine looks a lot like your eye
And here comes the moon like a fool
There goes my heart I swear I dreamt this part like idiots usually do
Why we do that now you know its true
Come over here and wind up my ear
Cause somebody wants me brand new
And they say if you're smart
Then you won't buy used parts
So I'm glad you're an idiot too
